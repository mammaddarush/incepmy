# Update package list & install Nginx + OpenSSL for HTTPS 
# - The apt update command updates the package list
# - The apt install command installs Nginx and OpenSSL
# - The apt-get clean command cleans up the package cache

# Generate a self-signed SSL certificate
# - The certificate will be stored in the /etc/ssl/certs directory
# - The private key will be stored in the /etc/ssl/private directory
# - The certificate will be valid for 365 
# -x509: This option outputs a self-signed certificate instead of a certificate request
# -nodes: This option tells OpenSSL to skip the option to secure the certificate with a passphrase
# -days: This option specifies the number of days the certificate will be valid for
# -newkey rsa:2048: This option creates a new certificate request and a new private key
# -keyout: This option specifies the filename to write the newly created private key to
# -out: This option specifies the filename to write the newly created certificate to
# -subj: This option sets the subject of the certificate
# -C: Country Name (2 letter code)
# -ST: State or Province Name (full name)
# -L: Locality Name (eg, city)
# -O: Organization Name (eg, company)
# -OU: Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)
# -CN: Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name)

 # run the command to start Nginx
# - The -g option allows you to pass a global configuration directive to Nginx
# - The daemon off; directive tells Nginx to run in the foreground
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

# result:
# - The Dockerfile will build an image that runs Nginx with a self-signed SSL certificate
